How to Play the Game
The game board consists of twelve to sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.

nnnnééééé
The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
